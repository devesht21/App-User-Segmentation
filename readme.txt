## Key Features
- **Data Analysis:** Utilized pandas for data manipulation and exploration to understand the characteristics of app users.
- **Visualization:** Employed matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for creating informative visualizations to gain insights into user behavior and patterns.
- **Clustering:** Applied K-means clustering to categorize users into different segments based on their app usage patterns.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis and clustering.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Data visualization for exploratory analysis.
- **Plotly:** Used for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Applied K-means clustering using scikit-learn's implementation.
